## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### Sensor Fusion Pipeline
```python
# Real-time multi-modal fusion with confidence weighting
if illumination_score > 0.5:
    weights = (0.8, 0.2)  # Favor RGB in good light
else:
    weights = (0.3, 0.7)  # Favor thermal in low light

fused_pose = sensor_fusion.estimate_pose(
    primary_features, secondary_features, weights, cross_matches
)
```

### Failure Recovery Hierarchy
1. **✅ Graceful Degradation**: Thermal-only or RGB-only fallback
2. **✅ IMU Dead Reckoning**: Short-term pose estimation (≤5 seconds) 
3. **✅ Relocalization**: SLAM re-init with relaxed parameters
4. **✅ Emergency Mode**: Hover-in-place with low confidence flag

### Edge Case Handling
- **✅ Complete Darkness**: Thermal-only operation mode
- **✅ Sensor Failures**: Automatic fallback detection and switching
- **✅ Low Confidence**: System health monitoring with alerts
- **✅ Processing Delays**: Performance tracking and optimization
